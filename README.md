<h1>Hello, I'm Chris Bridges!</h1>

<p>I am currently employed as a production and process engineering manager in aerospace manufacturing, and I'm looking to transition to a career in software engineering.
  I received my first BS in Biology and Chemistry from Texas A&M University. Now I'm enrolled at Oregon State University, working towards a BS in Computer Science.
  I got started by teaching myself programming to create custom applications for statistical process control, yield analysis, and defect tracking in my current career,
  but I decided I enjoyed it so much I would aim for a career transition.
